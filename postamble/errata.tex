\begin{itemize}

\item p.~79, under Eq.~4.23 should say: the left--hand sides of Eq.~4.22 and Eq.~4.23 are equal.

\item p.~42, Eq.~2.47 should read $$Y_\nu(x) = \frac{\cos(\nu \pi)J_\nu(x) - J_{-\nu}(x)}{\sin(\nu \pi)}$$

\item p.~112, above Eq.~5.20, the text should read
"When the eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair, the matrix can be diagonalised using complex numbers. However, a more useful \emph{real} canonical form of such a matrix can be proven to be:"
