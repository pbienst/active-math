    "# The Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting point: the continuous-time case\n",
    "\n",
    "As you recall, a continuous-time periodic function $f(t)$ with angular frequency $\\omega_0=2 \\pi f = 2 \\pi / T$ can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty a_n e^{jn\\omega_0 t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an expression can be considered as an inverse Fourier Transform (FT), i.e. an operation going from a representation by coefficients $a_n$ in the frequency domain to a representation $f(t)$ in the time-domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients $a_n$ are given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_n = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T f(t) e ^{-jn\\omega_0 t} dt$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The expression above can be considered as a forward Fourier Transform, i.e. from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving to discrete time\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose that instead of a continuous-time function $f(t)$, we have a discrete-time signal given e.g. by a set of samples $x[k]=f(k \\Delta t)$, with $\\Delta t$ the sampling period. In that case, we use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) rather than the regular FT. The DFT is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} x[k] e^{-j 2 \\pi k n /N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To better illustrate the relationship between the DFT and FT, let's look at $-j n \\omega_0 t$ in the formula for the FT. This becomes $-j n \\frac{2 \\pi}{T}  t = -j n \\frac{2 \\pi}{T} k \\Delta t$. If we need $N$ samples to cover our period $T$, i.e. if $T=N \\Delta t$, this becomes $-j n \\frac{2 \\pi}{N \\Delta t} k \\Delta t = -j n \\frac{2 \\pi}{N} k $. This is exactly what we have in the exponential in the DFT. (Note that this is a rather handwaving argument. The full derivation is more involved and relies on convolutions, delta functions and sync functions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, an expression like $-j 2 \\pi f t = -j 2 \\pi \\frac{n}{N \\Delta t} k \\Delta t$ makes it crystal clear that $k$ is a temporal index, with samples separated in time by $\\Delta t$, whereas $n$ is a frequency index, with different frequencies separated by $ \\frac{1}{N \\Delta t}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the inverse DFT, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x[k]=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} X[n] e^{j 2 \\pi k n /N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our discrete-time signal $x[k]$ is the sum over many frequency contributions. Each term in the sum is a complex exponential $e^{j 2 \\pi k n /N}$ with a complex-valued amplitude $X[n]$. This is very remininscent of what we had with phasors in the continuous time domain. There, we associated a complex amplitude to an oscillation described by a complex exponential $e^{j \\omega t}$. Here, we do the same thing, but in discrete time.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: There also exists something called the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), which is similar but different. It is used for aperiodic functions, with intergration limits from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$, rather than from 0 to $T$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In case $N$ is a power of 2, there is a very efficient implementation of the DTF, which is called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n",
    "\n",
    "## First numerical experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now play around with some numerical experiments of the DFT in NumPy. Be aware that other definitions/conventions in terms of the sign in the exponential or normalisation factors are possible. The conventions used here are typical for engineering. Look up the definition used by NumPy for its DFT implementation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html#implementation-details). What convention do they use? Note that the name FFT is so ubiquitous that the function called ```fft``` can also be used if $N$ is not a power of 2. It will then fall back on slower algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, start from a sine wave with frequency 2 Hz, and construct a discrete version of it by sampling at 10 points per period. Plot one period of the original function, as well as the sampled points."

    "\n",
    "Our complex exponential for the $n$-th frequency is $e^{j 2 \\pi k n /N}$, with $k$ and $n$ being  integer indices that represent time and frequency respectively. We know that if we add an integer multiple of $2 \\pi$ to the argument of a complex exponential, nothing changes. It's easy to check that replacing $k$ by $k + N$, or $n$ by $n + N$ does exactly that. This results in the time being shifted from $t$ to $t + N \\Delta t = t + T$, and the frequency being shifted from $f$ to $f + N \\frac{1}{N \\Delta t} = f +  \\frac{1}{ \\Delta t} $. So, the function is periodic in time with period $T$ (we already knew that!), but it's also periodic in frequency with period $\\frac{1}{ \\Delta t}$. Because this frequency period is the inverse of the sampling time, it's also called the **sampling frequency $f_s$**.\n",
