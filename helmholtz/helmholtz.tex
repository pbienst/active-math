To start with, let's recall Maxwell's curl equations in the time domain. In the absence of current sources, they are given by

\begin{equation}
\nabla \times {\mathbf E} ({\mathbf r},t) = - \mu({\mathbf r)} \frac{\partial {\mathbf H} ({\mathbf r} ,t)}{\partial t} \label{eq-rot-E}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\nabla \times {\mathbf H} ({\mathbf r},t) = \varepsilon({\mathbf r}) \frac{\partial {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r},t)}{\partial t} \label{eq-rot-H}
\end{equation}

For the common case of linear isotropic media, the dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and the magnetic permeability $\mu$ are scalars, which can however be a function of the spatial coordinate ${\mathbf r}$.

In the next chapters, we will restrict ourselves to the important case where all the fields have a harmonic time dependence with a fixed frequency $\omega$, e.g. for the $x$--component of the electric field:

\begin{equation}
E_x({\mathbf r},t) = E_{x,0}({\mathbf r}) \cos \left( \omega t + \phi_{E_x} ({\mathbf r})
\right) \label{eq-phasor}
\end{equation}

Similar expressions can be written for the other field components and for the magnetic field. It is convenient to introduce a complex number $\tilde{E}_x$ called a \emph{phasor}, that is defined as

\begin{equation}
\tilde{E}_x(\mathbf{r})=E_{x,0}({\mathbf r}) e^{j \phi_{E_x}({\mathbf r})} \label{eq:phasor}
\end{equation}

\begin{cue}
Given such a complex-valued phasor, how can we recover the real-valued electric field?
\end{cue}

\pagebreak

\noindent\marginnote{Note that some people use a different convention, which results in $e^{-j \omega t}$. This can give rise to some surprising sign changes in formulas, so be aware of this!}The relation between the phasor and the electric field is given by

\begin{equation}
    E_x({\mathbf r},t) = \Re \left(\tilde{E}_x({\mathbf r}) e^{j \omega t}\right)\label{eq:phasor-time-dep}
\end{equation}

\begin{cue}
What is the phasor corresponding to $\partial E_x({\mathbf r},t) / \partial t$ ?
\end{cue}

By taking the time derivative of Eq.~\ref{eq-phasor}, it is easy to show that 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial E_x({\mathbf r},t)}{\partial t} = \Re \left(j \omega \tilde{E}_x({\mathbf r}) e^{j \omega t}\right)
\end{equation}

Therefore, the phasor corresponding to $\partial E_x({\mathbf r},t) / \partial t$ is given by $j \omega \tilde{E}_x({\mathbf r})$.

In what follows, we will omit the tilde and implicitly assume that we are always dealing with phasors. We can also collect the phasors for all field components in complex vectors ${\mathbf E}$ and ${\mathbf H}$. 

\begin{cue}
Write Eq.~\ref{eq-rot-E} and \ref{eq-rot-H} using phasor notation.
\end{cue}

Using phasor notation, Eq.~\ref{eq-rot-E} and \ref{eq-rot-H} become

\begin{equation}
\nabla \times {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r}) = - j \omega \mu({\mathbf r}) {\mathbf H}({\mathbf r})
\label{eq-rot-E-phas}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}   
\nabla \times {\mathbf H}({\mathbf r}) = j \omega \varepsilon({\mathbf r}) {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r}) \label{eq-rot-H-phas}
\end{equation}

These are Maxwell's equations expressed in the frequency domain.

How do you need to change Eq.~\ref{eq-phasor} to get the correct time dependence for $E_x$, if you choose to use $e^{-j \omega t}$ in the conversion between time and frequency domain in Eq.~\ref{eq:phasor-time-dep}?

\begin{cue}
Take the curl of Eq.~\ref{eq-rot-E-phas} (assume $\mu$ is constant) and use Eq.~\ref{eq-rot-H-phas}.
\end{cue}

This results in

\begin{equation}
  \nabla \times \nabla \times {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r}) = \omega^2 \varepsilon({\mathbf r}) \mu {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r})
  \label{eq-helm-1}
\end{equation}

From vector calculus we know that

\begin{equation}
\nabla \times \nabla \times {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r}) = \nabla (\nabla \cdot {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r})) - \nabla^2 {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r})
\end{equation}

\begin{cue}
Use this to simplify Eq. \ref{eq-helm-1} in a uniform medium without charge $\rho$. 
\end{cue}

Let's for the moment consider a uniform medium without charge $\rho$. In that case, Maxwell's divergence laws tell us that $\nabla \cdot {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r})=0$, leading to

\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r}) + k^2 {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r}) = 0 \label{eq-helmholtz}
\end{equation}

where we have introduced the wave vector $k=\omega \sqrt{\varepsilon \mu}$.

Eq.~\ref{eq-helmholtz} is called the (vectorial) Helmholtz equation. Note that the same equation can also be derived for the magnetic field ${\mathbf H}$ (see Ex.  \ref{ex-helm-h-uniform}). So, in Cartesian coordinates, each of the vectorial components of ${\mathbf E}$ and ${\mathbf H}$ satisfy a scalar Helmholtz equation:

\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \psi({\mathbf r}) + k^2 \psi({\mathbf r}) = 0 \label{eq-helmholtz-1}
\end{equation}

Now, if we are studying a system which has a piecewise constant refractive index, Eq.~\ref{eq-helmholtz-1} will be valid in each of the uniform subregions. So formally we can write for the scalar Helmholtz equation in a medium with discrete index jumps:

\begin{equation}
\fbox{$\displaystyle \nabla^2 \psi({\mathbf r}) + k_0^2 n^2({\mathbf r}) \psi({\mathbf r}) = 0
\label{eq-helmholtz-3}$}
\end{equation}

Here, $k_0=\omega \sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}$ is the wave vector in vacuum, and the refractive index $n$ is defined by $n=\sqrt{\varepsilon \mu} / \sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}$.

Eq.~\ref{eq-helmholtz-3} is strictly speaking only valid \emph{inside} each uniform subregion. At the interface between different media we still have to deal with the appropriate continuity conditions for the fields.

Since $\psi$ is a complex number, it seems worthwhile to study the calculus of functions of a complex variable. We will see that this has a number of direct applications in photonics, e.g. the Kramers--Kronig dispersion relations, and the use of conformal transformations to study waveguide bends.

The phasor representation is obviously a Fourier transform in disguise. You might recall that a numerical implementation of this is the so-called Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), of which the famous Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a special case.
